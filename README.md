# llmsh
A large language model as your terminal shell.
Note this is a very rough prototype state. 

First get a OPEN_API_KEY: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Set your OPENAI_API_KEY key in a .env file or in os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = OPENAI_API_KEY . 

Then to run this create a virtualenv and then install everything in requirements.txt . 

Then chmod +x llmsh.py and run  ./llmsh.py it should pop up.
